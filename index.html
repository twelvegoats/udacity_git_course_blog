      <p>
        My favorite book is Ready Player 1 by Ernest Cline. It is a
        science-fiction novel that takes place in a dystopian future where
        people escape their harsh realities by entering a virtual reality world
        called the OASIS. The story follows a teenager named Wade Watts as he
        embarks on a quest to find an Easter egg hidden within the OASIS that
        will grant the finder immense wealth and control over the virtual world.
        The book is filled with 80s pop culture references, thrilling action
        sequences, and a compelling story about friendship, love, and the power
        of imagination.
